// Problem Statement: Given a string s, representing a large integer, the task is to return the largest-valued odd integer (as a string) that is a substring of the given string s.
// The number returned should not have leading zero's. But the given input string may have leading zero.
// Example 1
// Input: s = "5347"
// Output: "5347"
// Explanation: The odd numbers formed by the given string are → 5, 3, 53, 347, 5347. The largest odd number without leading zeroes is 5347.

// Example 2
// Input: s = "0214638"
// Output: "21463"
// Explanation: The odd numbers formed by the string are → 1, 3, 21, 63, 463, 1463, 21463. We can't use numbers starting with 0, so the largest valid odd number is 21463.
